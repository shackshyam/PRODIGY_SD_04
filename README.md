## Sudoku Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver. Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: Automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm.
- **Input Formats**: Supports both manual input of puzzles and reading from external files.
- **Output**: Provides solutions to puzzles and can also display the solved Sudoku grid.

## Requirements
